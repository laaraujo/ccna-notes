# CCNA 200-301 Notes

Personal notes for learning [CCNA](https://www.cisco.com/site/us/en/learn/training-certifications/certifications/enterprise/ccna/index.html) topics.
Originally intended to be Networking in general **but** since the CCNA certification is widely accepted as the go-to for Networking fundamentals I decided to stick to its program.
